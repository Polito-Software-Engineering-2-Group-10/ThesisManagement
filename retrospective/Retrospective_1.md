**Remember:** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
    - estimate: h/task 3h03m, stddev 3h17m
    - actual: h/task 2h52m, stddev 3h05m
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
    - 0.059 / 6%

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h
  - Total hours spent: 8h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 38
  - Coverage (if available): 71%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 5h
  - Total hours spent: 4h 
  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  We don't have a substancial error in the total estimation but we had a few errors in the estimation of single tasks, where more or less time was spent than expected. This is mostly due to the fact that we underestimated tasks that we thought should've been easier like designing the web pages due to having to learn the frameworks and adapting to coding techniques that some of us weren't familiar with, at the same time we overestimated the time needed to document the database and backend and to test the code which took less time than expected because it was mostly already done from the designing phase.


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  We learnt that communication between peers can make a significant difference in the success or the failure of accomplishing a goal.
  We learnt how to help each other when someone gets trouble in coding or can not finish their tasks on time due to personal issues.
  

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

  The improvement goals that we have set in the previous retrospective are:
    - Improve the coordination and comunication between teammates: we had reserved more time to scrum meetings this time to make possible for everyone to stay updated with other's work.    
    - Managing better the hours assignd to each one of us.

   
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  We achieved the second one partially but there is still room for improvement because we still have a few problems with initial estimation of the tasks when there's not a clear idea of the scope of the project.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

   - Set more intermediate goals through the entire sprint to make sure teammates aren't waiting on needed features for too long so they can start working on their tasks.
   - Avoid overworking on the last 2 days of the sprint to finish the needed tasks.
  

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  We are proud that we spent more time doing collaborative programming!!
